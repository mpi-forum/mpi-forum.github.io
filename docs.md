The official version of the MPI documents are the English Postscript versions (for MPI 1.0 and 1.1) and PDF (for the other versions). In several cases, a translation or HTML version is also available for convenience. The HTML version was made with automated tools. In case of a difference between these two sources, the Postscript or PDF version of MPI standard documents are always considered the official version. In the case of multiple PDF versions, only the one described as the "MPI x.y document as PDF" is the official version; the versions provided with alternate formatting are provided as a convenience and are not official (every effort has been taken to make them "the same", but no guarantee is made).

Some [translations of MPI documents](translations.html) are available.

## MPI 4.1

MPI-4.1 was approved by the MPI Forum on November 2, 2023.

*   [MPI 4.1 document as PDF](mpi-4.1/mpi41-report.pdf)
*   [BibTeX file for citing MPI 4.1](mpi-4.1/citation.bib)
*   [Unofficial HTML version of MPI 4.1](mpi-4.1/mpi41-report/mpi41-report.htm)


## MPI 4.0

MPI-4.0 was approved by the MPI Forum on June 9, 2021.

*   [MPI 4.0 document as PDF](mpi-4.0/mpi40-report.pdf)

Because of the size, this version does not have a book version. The PDF version
above is the only official version.

A side document that provides the list of MPI procedures that are
associated with an MPI operation, or inquiry procedures providing information
about an operation, was produced and is available (see below for
"Summary of the Semantics of all Operation-Related MPI Procedures")
