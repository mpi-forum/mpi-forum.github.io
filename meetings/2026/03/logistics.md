### Meeting Registration

**Registration is required regardless of whether attending in-person or remote.**

#### Registration Fee

The registration fee for in-person attendance is $200 + Eventbrite fees. This
will cover food, meeting space, security, etc.

There is no registration fee for people attending remotely.

#### Meeting Registration and Voting

**All attendees (in-person or remote)** must complete this form to be eligible
to attend the meeting and vote.

Registration is via [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/1981859425893).

### Meeting Location

The meeting will be hosted by Meta in New York City, New York, USA.

380 W 33rd St, New York, NY 10001 <br />
[Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/b33UUvTbUpPQAjt98)

You can enter directly from 33rd street, though there isn't signage there to
indicate that it's a Meta office building. Once you are inside, there will be a
registration desk with touch screen devices where you can sign in.
Pre-registration is required and when you arrive, one of the hosts from Meta
will come to the lobby to escort you to our meeting space.

When you register for the meeting on Eventbrite, you will receive an email with
a link to an NDA that you will need to sign as well as a code that you will
need when you arrive in order to pick up your visitor's badge. Please make sure
you have this code (there may even be a different code for each day).

### Hotels

The MPI Forum does not reserve a room block, but here are some hotels that are
near the meeting site.

* [Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Midtown Manhattan/Penn Station](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/nycps-fairfield-inn-and-suites-new-york-midtown-manhattan-penn-station/)
* [DoubleTree by Hilton New York Times Square South](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/nycsodt-doubletree-new-york-times-square-south/)
* [EVEN Hotel New York - Times Square South by IHG](https://www.ihg.com/evenhotels/hotels/us/en/new-york/nyctt/hoteldetail)


### Travel

Newark, NJ is the simplest airport to get to and from the meeting site. You can
use the airport train system to get to the New Jersey rail system which will
drop you off directly across the street from the office (Penn Station New York,
not New Jersey). Other NYC area airports will also work, but local travel may
be more complex.

### Remote Participation

The meeting times will be during business hours in the local time zone (Central
US). Remote participation will also be available via Zoom. The appropriate
links to the meeting will be posted before the meeting to the usual [wiki
page](https://github.com/mpi-forum/mpi-standard/wiki/Virtual-Forum-Meeting-Information).
