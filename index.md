## Current Efforts

The MPI Forum is currently pursuing two future versions of the MPI Standard:
* [MPI 4.1](mpi-41/): A minor update focusing on document cleanup and minor additions
* [MPI 5.0](mpi-50/): A standard update following MPI 4.1 with major new features
More details can be found in the respective sections.

## MPI 4.0 Standard

The MPI Forum has released a new version of MPI on June 9, 2021.
This version is available here:

[MPI 4.0 Standard](docs/mpi-4.0/mpi40-report.pdf)

Comments on the MPI 4.0 should be sent to the [MPI Comments mailing list](/comments).
