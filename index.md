## Current Efforts

The MPI Forum is currently pursuing at least one future version of the MPI Standard:

* [MPI 4.2](mpi-42/): A standard update following MPI 4.1 with smaller features
* [MPI 5.0](mpi-50/): A standard update following MPI 4.1 with major new features

More details can be found in the respective sections.
