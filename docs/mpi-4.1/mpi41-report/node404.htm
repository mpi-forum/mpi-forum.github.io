<p>
The objective of the <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> profiling interface is to ensure that it is  
relatively easy for authors of profiling (and other similar) tools to  
interface their codes to <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> implementations on different machines.  
<P> 
Since <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> is a machine independent standard with many different  
implementations, it is unreasonable to expect that the authors of profiling  
tools for <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> will have access to the source code that  implements <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font>  
on any particular machine.  It is therefore necessary to provide a  
mechanism by which the implementors of such tools can collect whatever  
performance information they wish <em> without</em> access to the underlying  
implementation.  
<P> 
We believe that having such an interface is important if <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> is to be  
attractive to end users, since the availability of many different tools  
will be a significant factor in attracting users to the <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> standard.  
<P> 
The profiling interface is just that, an interface.  It says <em> nothing</em>  
about the way in which it is used.  There is therefore no attempt to lay  
down what information is collected through the interface, or how the  
collected information is saved, filtered, or displayed.  
<P> 
While the initial impetus for the development of this interface arose from  
the desire to permit the implementation of profiling tools, it is clear  
that an interface like that specified may also prove useful for other  
purposes, such as ``internetworking'' multiple <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> implementations.  
Since all that is defined is an interface, there is no objection to it  
being used wherever it is useful.  
<P> 
As the issues being addressed here are intimately tied up with the way in  
which executable images are built, which may differ greatly on different  
machines, the examples given below should be treated solely as one way of  
implementing the objective of the <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> profiling interface.  The actual  
requirements made of an implementation are those detailed in the  
Requirements section above, the whole of the rest of this section is only  
present as justification and discussion of the logic for those  
requirements.  
<P> 
The examples below show one way in which an implementation could be  
constructed to meet the requirements on a Unix system (there are doubtless  
others that  would be equally valid).  
<P>
